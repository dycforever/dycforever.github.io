405: Method Not Allowed
303: See Other

可以通过web.ctx.env.get('HTTP_REFERER', 'http://google.com')这样的方式获得很多上下文相关的信息
Request
environ a.k.a. env – a dictionary containing the standard WSGI environment variables
home – the base path for the application, including any parts "consumed" by outer applications http://example.org/admin
homedomain – ? (appears to be protocol + host) http://example.org
homepath – The part of the path requested by the user which was trimmed off the current app. That is homepath + path = the path actually requested in HTTP by the user. E.g. /admin This seems to be derived during startup from the environment variable REAL_SCRIPT_NAME. It affects what web.url() will prepend to supplied urls. This in turn affects where web.seeother() will go, which might interact badly with your url rewriting scheme (e.g. mod_rewrite)
host – the hostname (domain) and (if not default) the port requested by the user. E.g. example.org, example.org:8080
ip – the IP address of the user. E.g. xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
method – the HTTP method used. E.g. GET
path – the path requested by the user, relative to the current application. If you are using subapplications, any part of the url matched by the outer application will be trimmed off. E.g. you have a main app in code.py, and a subapplication called admin.py. In code.py, you point /admin to admin.app. In admin.py, you point /stories to a class called stories. Within stories, web.ctx.path will be /stories, not /admin/stories. E.g. /articles/845
protocol – the protocol used. E.g. https
query – an empty string if there are no query arguments otherwise a ? followed by the query string. E.g. ?fourlegs=good&twolegs=bad
fullpath a.k.a. path + query – the path requested including query arguments but not including homepath. E.g. /articles/845?fourlegs=good&twolegs=bad
Response
status – the HTTP status code (default '200 OK') 401 Unauthorized
headers – a list of 2-tuples containing HTTP headers
output – a string containing the response entity

可以通过web.config.session_parameters['cookie_name'] = 'webpy_session_id'这样的方式设置session参数，有如下的session参数：

cookie_name - name of the cookie used to store the session id
cookie_domain - domain for the cookie used to store the session id
timeout - number of second of inactivity that is allowed before the session expires
ignore_expiry - if True, the session timeout is ignored
ignore_change_ip - if False, the session is only valid when it is accessed from the same ip address that created the session
secret_key - salt used in session id hash generation
expired_message - message displayed when the session expires
